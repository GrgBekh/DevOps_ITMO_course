# DevOps_ITMO_course

This is a first lab of DevOps course at ITMO university

This code contains DAG for dot product computing

You can just simply clone this branch and use docker-compose up -d and specify ports if needed
default is 8080

I do not like to push empty folders to git repo, so you can either create plugins, config and logs dirs
or let the docker do the work (with warnings) you need root user anyway, so it will still require chmod

Enjoy
